    P1--> Javascript is a function-oriented language. Everything we write in javascript in the form of function. 
    P2--> If you want to write a class, you write a function that is a so-called class. 
    P3--> Everything must have a data type, so everything is an object also because they inherited 
           from the object class.
    P4--> Just like everything functions are also an object of the Function type.
